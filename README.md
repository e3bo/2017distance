These files are available to reproduce the results for the manuscript
"Estimating the distance to an epidemic threshold." The most important
files are the R scripts that contain the code for all of the
calculations. The Makefile shows the correct order to run the scripts
in to generate all of the results. The packrat directory contains a
packrat archive of all of the R packages used by the scripts. The
Docker file gives the instructions for building a docker image in
which the R scripts may be run. A Docker image built with this script
is available on Docker Hub. So, on a system with Docker installed,
running the bash script ``run-scripts`` from within the directory
containing this README will pull down the image and run the Makefile
inside of it to reproduce all of the results. The results will be
placed in a time-stamped subdirectory. Reproducing the results takes
less the 40 minutes on a workstation with 20 2.1GHz processors and 188 G
of memory. The results themselves use up about 500M of disk.
